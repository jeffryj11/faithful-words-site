There is a song that I often find myself singing in my head while I go about my day, and it goes like this:

> Change my heart, oh God  
> May I be like You  
> You are the Potter  
> I am the clay  
> Mold me and make me  
> This is what I pray  
> Change my heart, Oh God  

As I sing these words, I think of how He has such a soft heart for us—such a deep, compassionate love for each of us. I am in awe, and a little ashamed too, because the truth is that my heart is not always soft, and has at times been hard as a rock and unyielding to His love and the love of others.

That is why I spend time each morning in prayer and reading scripture—because that is the only way I can become His clay and let Him be the Potter and soften and shape my heart into one that becomes more and more like His every day.

It means that I choose what I place into my heart, and guard my heart from anything that keeps me from becoming what He created me to be—which is soft like clay.

Just imagine how it could be if we all softened our hearts towards each other and to the One who created us, just like He promised.

**Ezekiel 36:26**  
> “And I will give you a new heart and I will put a new spirit in you,  
> I will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a tender, responsive heart.”
